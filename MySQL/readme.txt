Welcome to the installation of our cocktail database.


Note: All the following instructions take place in the MySQL-Workbench.

We start with the document "CreateRecipeDB". You have to execute this SQL-script once completely.
After that we continue with the document "LoadDataRecipeDB" - here you have to adjust the path 
of the CSV-files contained in this folder. (The "TODO" indicates the relevant sections)
Please ensure consistent use of "\\" or "/".

Afterwards you also need to run that script once completely.
Finally the included "SELECT" statements can be used for verification.

Thank you for choosing our product.
Best regards JJTN
